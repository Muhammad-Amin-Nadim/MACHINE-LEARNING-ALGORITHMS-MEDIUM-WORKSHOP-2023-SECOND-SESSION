    "Some machine learning practitioners tend to standardize their data blindly before each machine learning model without making the effort to understand why it should be used, or even whether it is needed or not.

    "StandardScaler removes the mean and scales the data to the unit variance. However, outliers have an influence when calculating the empirical mean and standard deviation, which narrows the range of characteristic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These differences in the initial features can cause problems for many machine learning models. For example, for models based on the calculation of distance, if one of the features has a wide range of values, the distance will be governed by that particular characteristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the StandardScaler is that variables that are measured at different scales do not contribute equally to the fit of the model and the learning function of the model and could end up creating a bias. \n",
