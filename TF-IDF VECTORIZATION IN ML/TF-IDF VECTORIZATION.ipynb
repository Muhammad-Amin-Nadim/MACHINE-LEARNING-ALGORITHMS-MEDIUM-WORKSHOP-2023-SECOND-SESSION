However, one would expect the terms “cat” and “kitten” to appear in many documents (high frequency of documents implies low IDF), while the term “furry” will appear in fewer documents (IDF taller). Thus, the TF-IDF for cat & kitten has a low value while the TF-IDF is larger for “hairy”, that is to say, that in our database the word “hairy” has more power. discriminating as “cat” or “kitten”.\n",
